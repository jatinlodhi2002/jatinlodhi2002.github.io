# Complete Guide: Markdown Portfolio to GitHub Pages

## 📋 What You'll Need
- Your portfolio in Markdown format (`.md` file)
- GitHub account
- Git installed on Windows
- Basic command line knowledge

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Prepare Your Files

### Download the Template Files:
I've created all the necessary files for you. Make sure you have these files in a folder:

```
portfolio-project/
├── portfolio-template.html    (HTML template)
├── style.css                 (Professional CSS styles)
├── script.js                 (Interactive JavaScript)
├── convert-markdown.py       (Conversion script)
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── deploy.yml        (Auto-deployment)
└── your-portfolio.md         (Your markdown file)
```

### Rename Your Markdown File:
• Rename your markdown file to `portfolio.md` or keep it as `README.md`
• Place it in the same folder as the template files

---

## 🔧 Step 2: Convert Markdown to HTML (Local Testing)

### Install Python (if not already installed):
• Download Python from python.org
• Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

### Test the Conversion:
Open Command Prompt in your project folder and run:
```bash
# Navigate to your project folder
cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents\portfolio-project

# Convert your markdown to HTML
python convert-markdown.py portfolio.md
```

This will create:
- `index.html` - Your main portfolio page
- Uses existing `style.css` and `script.js`

### Preview Locally:
• Open `index.html` in your browser to see how it looks
• Make any adjustments to your markdown file if needed

---

## 📁 Step 3: Create GitHub Repository

### On GitHub Website:
• Log into GitHub
• Click **"+"** → **"New repository"**
• Repository name: `your-username.github.io` (replace with your actual username)
• Make it **Public**
• Don't add README (we'll upload our files)
• Click **"Create repository"**

---

## 💻 Step 4: Upload Files to GitHub

### Method A: Using Git Commands (Recommended)

#### Open Command Prompt and run:
```bash
# Navigate to your project folder
cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents\portfolio-project

# Initialize Git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit files
git commit -m "Initial portfolio setup with auto-deployment"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-username.github.io.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Note:** Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

### Method B: Using GitHub Web Interface (Alternative)

If Git commands don't work:
• Go to your repository on GitHub
• Click **"uploading an existing file"**
• Drag and drop all your files
• Commit the changes

---

## ⚙️ Step 5: Enable GitHub Pages with Actions

### Configure Repository Settings:
• Go to your repository on GitHub
• Click **"Settings"** tab
• Scroll to **"Pages"** in the left sidebar
• Under **"Source"**, select **"GitHub Actions"**
• The workflow will automatically deploy your site

### Wait for Deployment:
• Go to **"Actions"** tab in your repository
• You'll see a workflow running called "Deploy Portfolio to GitHub Pages"
• Wait for it to complete (green checkmark)

---

## 🌐 Step 6: Access Your Live Portfolio

### Your Portfolio URL:
```
https://your-username.github.io
```

### Check Deployment Status:
• Go to repository **"Settings"** → **"Pages"**
• You'll see: "Your site is live at https://your-username.github.io"
• Click the link to view your portfolio

---

## 🔄 Step 7: Update Your Portfolio (Automatic)

### The Magic of Auto-Deployment:
Once set up, updating is super easy:

#### To Update Your Portfolio:
1. **Edit your markdown file** (`portfolio.md`) locally
2. **Push changes to GitHub:**
```bash
# Navigate to your project folder
cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents\portfolio-project

# Add changes
git add .

# Commit with a message
git commit -m "Update portfolio with new project"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

3. **Automatic conversion happens:**
   - GitHub Actions automatically runs
   - Converts your markdown to HTML
   - Deploys the updated site
   - Your live site updates in 2-3 minutes

### No Manual Conversion Needed!
• Just edit your markdown file
• Push to GitHub
• The workflow handles everything else automatically

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions:

#### 1. "Git is not recognized" Error:
```bash
# Install Git from git-scm.com
# Restart Command Prompt after installation
git --version
```

#### 2. Repository Name Issues:
• Must be exactly: `your-username.github.io`
• Use your actual GitHub username
• Must be public repository

#### 3. Workflow Fails:
• Check **"Actions"** tab for error details
• Make sure `convert-markdown.py` is in the repository
• Ensure markdown file is named `portfolio.md` or `README.md`

#### 4. Site Shows 404:
• Wait 10-15 minutes after first deployment
• Check that `index.html` was created
• Verify GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings

#### 5. Markdown Not Converting Properly:
• Check your markdown file format
• Ensure sections use the expected headers:
  - `## 🚀 About Me`
  - `## 🛠️ Technical Skills`
  - `## 🎯 Featured Projects`
  - `## 💼 Professional Experience`
